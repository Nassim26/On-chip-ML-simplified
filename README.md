# On-chip ML made easy
This repository contains and describes the design of a basic on-chip machine learning framework for System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGAs using Direct Memory Access. To this end, we use the nifty PYNQ<sup>TM</sup> Python library, which simplifies the control and monitoring of the Programmable Logic (PL) and other board internals as well as the communication between the PL and the Processing System (PS) - i.e., the on-board microcontroller. Because the PYNQ library is a Python library, it is considerably easier to interface the various accelerators one might develop and deploy on the PL with the standard and powerful Python-based machine learning frameworks like PyTorch or JAX. As such, this project additionally showcases how to integrate your PL design into the standard PyTorch framework, maintaining control within the PS whilst the brute data processing is off-loaded to dedicated accelerators in the PL in the background. This repository guides you through the entire design process, from setting up an appropriate Vivado environment to getting started with PYNQ and integrating your accelerators with PyTorch.
