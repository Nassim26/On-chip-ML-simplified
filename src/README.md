# The Verilog source code
This directory contains the source code for the DMA wrapper which acts as the interface between your custom accelerators and the input/output of the data DMA module, as well as the code for the control module (interacting with the control DMA) and sample code for a CNN accelerator. Respectively, these can be found in ```DMA_wrapper.v```, ```control_module.v```, and the CNN code in the ```/CNN/``` subdirectory. This document describes these files. In order to fully understand the DMA wrapper and the control module, however, it is important to understand how the DMA modules themselves work, specifically the **AXI4-Stream protocol** over which they operate.
